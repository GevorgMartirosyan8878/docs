Amazon simple storage service is object storage service, in which object consists from data and metadata.

Metadata is a set of name-value pairs, which describe object. Buckets are containers for objects stored in Amazon S3.

An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID.

In S3 we can store any type of data, such as website, mobile app, enterprise app, backup, restore archive IoT devices big data analytics.

S3 can automatically scale to support virtually unlimited number of objects and unlimited amount of data.
Beside that it was a secure from unauthorized access by Encryption features and Access Management features.
Also, S3 block public access feature can be used to prevent public access to buckets and objects.

S3 more features

S3 provides wide range of storage classes

S3 Standard - frequently accessed data (часто используемые данные)

S3 Intelligent-Tiering - is for data with unknown or changing access patterns (для данных с неизвестными или изменяющимися шаблонами доступа)
It automatically moves our data between a frequent access and infrequent access tiers based on changing access patterns - without performance impact or operational overhead.

S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

S3 standard IA and S3 One Zone IA are for long lived but less frequently accessed data

S3 One Zone IA infrequent access only stores data in a single AZ, it fits best for data that can be recreated.

S3 Glacier storage classes are for long term archive and digital preservation

S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 standard IA and S3 one zone IA also have the same low latency and high throughput performance as S3 Standard.

S3 Glacier instant retrieval

S3 Glacier instant retrieval storage class delivers the lowest cost storage with millisecond retrieval. It is designed for archive data that needs immediate access.

For archive data that does not require immediate access choose S3 Glacier flexible retrieval, with retrieval in minutes, or free bulk retrievals in 5 to 12 hours.

To save even more on long lived archive storage, choose S3 Glacier Deep Archive, the lowest cost storage, with data retrieval from 12 to 48 hours.

To classify, manage and report on your data, Amazon S3 also provides easy to use management tools for granular data control. (granular - детальный)

Amazon S3 Access management

By default all Amazon S3 resources, such as buckets and object are private. Only resource owner, an AWS account that created it, can access the resource.
The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy.
Amazon S3 access policy is a JSON document that defines who can access a bucket or object, what permissions they have, and when they can access it.
Amazon S3 offers access policy options that can be broadly categorized as resource-based policies and user policies. (broadly - широко)

Resource-based policies are access policies that you can attach to your resources such as buckets and objects. Buccet policies and access control lists (ACLs) are resource based policies
We can also authenticate certain types of data access using query-sting authentication to grant temporary access to others with time limited URL's.

User policies are access policies that you attach to users. Access can be granted to users using AWS IAM policies or AWS SSO permission sets.

As a general rule AWS recommends using S3 bucket policies or IAM policies for access control.

When S3 receives a request from a user or application, it must evaluate all the access policies to determine whether to allow or deny the request.

Resource based policies

Access control lists (ACL)

Each bucket and object has an ACL. ACL use Amazon S3-specific XML schema. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access they have.
When we're creating a bucket or an object, S3 creates a default ACL that grants the resource owner full control over the resource.
We can use ACL to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. 


Bucket policies

A bucket policy, written in JSON, is attached to an S3 bucket. It provides access permissions to the S3 bucket and the objects in it.


It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access they have.
When we're creating a bucket, we can use the console to add a bucket policy. We can also use the console to edit or delete an existing bucket policy.

User Policies 

user policies control who has access to your S3 resources and is written in JSON.
We can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users, groups and roles in your account and attach access policies to grant them access to S3.
